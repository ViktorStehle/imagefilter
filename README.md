# Image filter with C
A project for my edx computer science course. 

I had to develope a good understanding of how C works and for further improvment I added extra filter ideas:
• Grayscale 
• Reflect
• Edges
• Blur
• Negative
• Redcolor
• Bluecolor
• Sepia
It takes a commend line argument and a file.bmp as input and gives an output.bmp with the choosen filter applied.
